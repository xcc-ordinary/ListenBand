## yt-dlp

ListenBand does not bundle or redistribute yt-dlp. If the user has installed
yt-dlp separately, the desktop plugin can invoke that local executable as an
optional subtitle-only fallback. See the
[yt-dlp project](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for its license and releases.

## ECDICT

ListenBand includes a compressed subset of the
[ECDICT English-Chinese dictionary database](https://github.com/skywind3000/ECDICT),
filtered to CET-4, CET-6, IELTS-tagged, and high-frequency entries. The bundled
snapshot is based on revision `bc015ed2e24a`. Users can optionally download the
full CSV from that same revision; ListenBand verifies its checksum and builds
local compressed indexes in the operating-system cache.
