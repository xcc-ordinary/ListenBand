### Fixed

## 1.0.1 - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

## 1.2.2 - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- The full ECDICT installer now prefers a prebuilt 24.4 MB ZIP package and automatically falls back to the official CSV source when the package is unavailable

- Added SHA-256 verification for the downloaded package and kept the previously installed dictionary available until the replacement is fully verified

### Added

- Added download and reuse of anonymous public Bilibili combined MP4 files in the operating system cache directory
- Added a controllable local Bilibili player with play, five-second seek, playback speed, and multi-segment continuation

- Added automatic fallback to Bilibili's official external player after cached files are removed
- Added a 2 GB per-video safety limit and strict Bilibili API/CDN allowlisting

### Changed

- Removed the bundled public InnerTube client key while retaining the independent keyless mobile-client caption fallback
- Replaced the fixed Live Preview recovery delay with focus, selection, mutation, and frame-driven editor-state monitoring that stops as soon as the study interface mounts
- New YouTube and Bilibili study blocks now always include a safe editor line after the closing code fence
- Added an immediate loading shell and reused cached transcript fingerprints when switching back to previously opened study notes
- Successful transcript imports now remove the matching long source link while preserving other text on the same line
- Replaced the former fixed-height transcript panel with a page-level transcript that has no internal scrolling window
- Existing Bilibili player-only blocks are upgraded in place with a transcript path instead of inserting a duplicate player
- Local Bilibili seeking now follows timestamps across progressive video segment boundaries
- Bilibili notes keep their transcript visible if the user removes the video cache and the player falls back to Bilibili's official iframe
- Removed the retired Distil Large V3 prototype and its obsolete settings while retaining optional local Whisper Base English alignment
- Removed the retired cloud speech-alignment prototype and its obsolete credentials
- Replaced the retired Chrome-helper prototype with direct subtitle requests and an isolated in-Obsidian Bilibili login session
- Added one-time cleanup limited to ListenBand's former Distil Large V3, Base, Small, and Whisper runtime caches
- Keeps SRT/VTT, player-only, transcript editing, translation, video cache, and version 1 note compatibility

### Fixed

- Made the automated test runner use the operating system's temporary directory on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Prevented CodeMirror from restoring `contain: paint` and clipping full-width transcript timestamps or text in Live Preview
- Restored the video player and transcript on the first return to YouTube and Bilibili study notes instead of leaving the `listenband` block in source-editing state
- Automatically repaired older standalone study notes whose closing code fence was the final character, without changing their block contents

## 1.1.0 - 2026-08-13

YouTube one-command import update.

### Added

- Added the command **ListenBand: 从 YouTube 链接创建学习内容** for Markdown notes

### Changed

- Cleans caption markup, entities, duplicate text, empty rows, and overlapping timelines before saving
- Keeps existing version 1 transcript files and legacy study blocks fully compatible
- Tries manual English subtitles before automatic English subtitles in both direct and yt-dlp routes
